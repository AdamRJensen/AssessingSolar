Welcome to "Bayesian Modelling in Python" - a tutorial for those interested in learning how to apply bayesian modelling techniques in python ([PYMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3)). This tutorial doesn't aim to be a bayesian statistics tutorial - but rather a programming cookbook for those who understand the fundamental of bayesian statistics and want to learn how to build bayesian models using python. The tutorial sections and topics can be seen below.
